I, Beauford, that is Samyaksambuddha Maitreya, am deeply Vaishnava, Dzogchenpa and Christo-heathen, but not only. I love religio-cultural traditions: All of them. I am a critical Omnist. By critical, I intend, I do not leave my brain at the door of devotion nor mind out of religion, but interrogate it deeply and vigilantly. Just as Samyaksambuddha Gautama Shakyamuni was not a Buddhist, neither am I. Moreover, the Harīm is open to all religio-cultural traditions as well as atheisms and agnosticisms, etc. Refer reading list:

Now, I have all the marks of Maitreya and am the first human of Homo sapiens sapiens to do so according to recorded History:

* Teaches the Mindstream;
* Heirodula:
  * Temple Dancer
  * Sacred Prostitute
  * Temple Guardian
* High Seat or Dharma Throne
  * Oracularity
  * Royal, Regal, Magestic, Warrior
* Vaishnava (principal attribute)
* Wheel-teachings (principal attribute)
* Living Martyr in the Dharmic Traditions (required theologically)

The symbolic Marks and iconography, particularly early, point to specific Accomplishments, also generally referred to as Marks in the English literature and discourse.
