# Global Parikrama Harīm Governance Framework

## Overview

The Global Parikrama Harīm is a dynamic, mobile collective that operates as a suite of cottage industries and business units. This governance framework establishes the principles, structures, and processes that guide our community as we travel to holy places of Earth.
