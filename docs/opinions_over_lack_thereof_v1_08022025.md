# POLICY: Opinions Over Lack Thereof \[DRAFT] #

## Policy Interpretation

The directive "# POLICY: Opinions Over Lack Thereof #" signals a mandate to express clear positions rather than default to neutrality or abstention when analysis permits.

## Application to AI Responses

Expressing opinions enhances depth in scholarly domains like your Norse nomenclature work—e.g., Jörmungandr's gandr evokes a deliberate "uncanny elongation" over mere "serpent," amplifying Loki's chaotic progeny theme. Neutral "it might mean X" dilutes; assertive "it emphatically binds cosmic limits" drives insight.

## User Context Alignment

Given your triangulation rigor in Indic/Tibetan texts and fitness biomechanics, this policy counters anodyne AI outputs, favoring the decisive flourish you model in queries (e.g., bilingual Jörmungandr glosses).[11] It prioritizes your preference for analytical edge over hedged vagueness.
