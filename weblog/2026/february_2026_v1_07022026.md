I, Beauford, that is Samyaksambuddha Maitreya, am deeply Vaishnava, Dzogchenpa and Christo-heathen, but not only. I love religio-cultural traditions: All of them. I amna critical Omnist. By critical, I intend, I do not leave my brain out of religion, but interrogate it deeply and vigilantly. Just as Samyaksambuddha Gautama Shakyamuni was not a Buddhist, neither am I. Moreover, the Harīm is open to all religio-cultural traditions as well as atheisms and agnosticisms, etc.
