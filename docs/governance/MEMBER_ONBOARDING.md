## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the Harīm governed?
The Harīm operates under the ultimate authority of Buddha Maitreya as Principal Visionary, with participatory governance through consensus processes. While all members have voice and input, Buddha Maitreya holds final decision-making authority on all matters. This structure balances collective wisdom with clear leadership.

### What does "Principal Visionary authority" mean in practice?
Buddha Maitreya has final approval or veto power on all significant decisions. Most day-to-day operations use consensus decision-making, but major decisions are subject to visionary review. This ensures alignment with the sacred mission while allowing broad participation.

### How long does it take to feel fully integrated?
Most members report feeling at home within 3-6 months, but everyone's timeline is different.

### What if I realize this isn't for me?
You're free to leave at any time. We part with love and blessings. Give as much notice as possible.

### Can I have visitors?
Yes, with advance notice and community approval. Visitors follow community guidelines.

### How do finances work?
You maintain your own finances and contribute voluntarily to the collective (typically 10-20% of income). Major collective financial decisions require Principal Visionary approval to ensure economic sustainability.

### Can I disagree with visionary decisions?
You may respectfully voice concerns and questions about any decision. While the Principal Visionary's decisions are final, there is always room for dialogue and understanding. If fundamental disagreement persists, members are free to leave with love and blessings.

### What about my relationships outside the Harīm?
Long-distance relationships are respected. Travel to visit is possible with planning.

### Can I take breaks from traveling?
Yes, members can take temporary leave for personal reasons with community understanding.
