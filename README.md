# Global Parikrama Harīm

*A mobile spiritual community traveling to Earth's holy places*

## Overview

The Global Parikrama Harīm is a dynamic, mobile collective operating as a suite of cottage industries and business units. We are a creative and performative troupe on a continuous sacred pilgrimage (parikrama) to holy places around the world. Under the guidance of Buddha Maitreya, we embody poly-pansexual governance principles while nurturing children, supporting individual entrepreneurship, and serving communities we visit.
