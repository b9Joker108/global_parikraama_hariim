# Global Parikrama Harīm Governance Framework

## Overview

The Global Parikrama Harīm is a dynamic, mobile collective that operates as a suite of cottage industries and business units. This governance framework establishes the principles, structures, and processes that guide our community as we travel to holy places of Earth.

## Foundational Principles

### 1. Poly-Pansexual Governance
- **Inclusive Leadership**: All governance structures embrace poly-pansexual perspectives and relationships
- **Consent-Based Decision Making**: All decisions affecting personal and collective matters require informed consent
- **Relationship Autonomy**: Individual sovereignty in personal relationships while maintaining collective responsibility

### 2. Buddha Maitreya Guidance
- **Spiritual Leadership**: Recognition of Buddha Maitreya's role as spiritual guide and Principal Visionary
- **Ultimate Authority**: Buddha Maitreya holds final decision-making power on all matters affecting the Harīm
- **Compassionate Action**: All decisions guided by compassion, wisdom, and loving-kindness
- **Dharma Alignment**: Actions aligned with Buddhist principles and universal truth
- **Binding Decisions**: The Principal Visionary's decisions are final and serve the collective's highest good

### 3. Mobile Collective Model
- **Adaptive Structure**: Governance adapts to different locations and contexts
- **Distributed Operations**: Operational power distributed across the collective under visionary guidance
- **Pilgrimage Integration**: Governance supports continuous travel and spiritual practice

## Visionary Authority Structure

The Global Parikrama Harīm operates under the ultimate authority of Buddha Maitreya (b9Joker108) as Principal Visionary, with binding decision-making power throughout the organization.

### Authority Hierarchy

The governance structure follows a clear hierarchy of authority:

1. **Buddha Maitreya (Principal Visionary)**: Ultimate authority on all decisions
2. **Leadership Council**: Operational authority delegated by the Principal Visionary
3. **Full Assembly**: Democratic participation subject to visionary approval
4. **Business Unit Circles**: Self-management within established guidelines

### Circumstances for Visionary Intervention

The Principal Visionary may intervene in any decision when:
- Decisions misalign with the sacred mission or dharmic principles
- Safety or wellbeing of members, especially children, is at risk
- Financial sustainability is threatened
- External relations or reputation require leadership
- Deadlocks or conflicts cannot be resolved through other means
- Swift action is needed beyond normal processes

### Visionary Override Protocol

When the Principal Visionary exercises override authority:
1. Clear communication of the override and rationale
2. Articulation of required changes or alternative direction
3. Implementation through Leadership Council
4. Documentation for transparency and learning

See [Leadership Authority Framework](LEADERSHIP_AUTHORITY.md) for comprehensive details on visionary authority.

## Decision-Making Processes

### Consensus Model

Consensus is the preferred method for most decisions, subject to Principal Visionary approval and potential override:

1. **Proposal**: Clear articulation of decision needed
2. **Discussion**: Open dialogue with all perspectives
3. **Clarification**: Questions and concerns addressed
4. **Refinement**: Proposal modified based on feedback
5. **Testing for Consensus**: Check for agreement or principled objections
6. **Resolution**: Agreement or creative synthesis of alternatives
7. **Visionary Approval**: Major decisions subject to Principal Visionary review and final approval

**Note**: The Principal Visionary may participate in consensus processes, delegate observation, or provide final approval. Consensus decisions serve as recommendations for significant matters requiring visionary authority.

### Visionary Override

When consensus decisions misalign with the Harīm's mission or require adjustment:

1. **Evaluation**: Principal Visionary assesses decision against core principles
2. **Communication**: Clear notification of override with detailed rationale
3. **Alternative Direction**: Articulation of required changes or new approach
4. **Implementation**: Leadership Council executes visionary directive
5. **Documentation**: Record maintained for transparency and learning

### Visionary Veto

The Principal Visionary may veto any decision that:
- Contradicts core spiritual principles or sacred mission
- Threatens member safety, wellbeing, or community sustainability
- Creates legal, ethical, or reputational risks
- Would generate harmful division or misalignment
- Requires better timing or alternative approach

Veto process includes clear communication of rationale and, when possible, suggestion of alternative paths forward.

### Emergency Protocols
